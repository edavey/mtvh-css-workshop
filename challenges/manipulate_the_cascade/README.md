# Challenge: manipulate the cascade

We want the selected repair (`.repair.selected`) to be larger than other repair elements.

We also want repair anchors which link to German language pages to have a different colour background. See `hreflang` attribute.

Edit the existing `<style>` tag or linked stylesheet.
