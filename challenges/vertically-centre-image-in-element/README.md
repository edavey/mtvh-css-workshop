# Challenge: vertical centering

We have an index page containing a grid of items.

Each item is is centered vertically within its grid cell.

As the items are of different shapes and sizes we want:

- all the grid cells to be the same shape
- all the items to be centered vertically within their cell

This is currently implemented in a nasty IE6 compliant hack. 

See if you can do something more modern and elegant.
